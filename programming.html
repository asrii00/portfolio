                <p>
                    I developed a backend server powering a customer service integration designed for an electricity company's needs.
                    The server accepts signals from an external system via an endpoint and sends Whatsapp Message Templates 
                    to the specified phone numbers. A webhook handles the customer's replies and routes them 
                    to a Mistral Completions powered chatbot system that utilizes LLM-based topic classification and retrieval-augmented 
                    generation (RAG) with basic safeguards implemented. The replies are relayed back to the user in the Whatsapp chat.
                    <br> <br>
                    In- and outbound signals, messages and user confirmations are logged in an SQLite database.
                    The Meta webhook has HMAC signature verification.
                    <br> <br>

                    

                    Mostly independent work but including collaboration with a frontend developer.

                    A companion robot software that utilizes OpenAI APIs and more to provide conversation and assistance
                    to the elderly - or people of any age. I developed the backend server (Python) and necessary
                    connections on
                    Nao6's end to allow the robot to record audio and images, which are then processed on the backend
                    using AI integrations
                    (speech-to-text, LLM, image content recognition). The robot then speaks its responses using its
                    internal text-to-speech engine.
                    <br> <br>
                    "Lumi" can also save reminders to its calendar database, fetch up-to-date news and weather and
                    display AI-powered emotions
                    using the color of its LED eyes and custom full-body animations. Additionally, it comes with a
                    reminiscing activity
                    that guides the user through nostalgia-inducing questions while offering empathetic, smart responses
                    to the user's speech.
                    <br> <br>

                    The first 2,5 months of the project were group work, the second half was independent work.

                    Much of the data used was biology-related, e.g. genome and protein data and bird sightings, so I got
                    to utilize my biology
                    knowledge gained during my previous studies. Alongside pure statistics, I also created interactive

                    that illustrate and gamify basic biology concepts. <br> <br>
